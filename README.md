My simple application that allow to register, verify email and log in users. 
I used express, mongoDB and some node libraries to do that. 
To use my app you have to set some env variables(to see which env variables are necessary please look at config folder).
I am aware that my code is not as perfect as it could be, but I am in learning phase of node. 
I hope that my next commits and repositories will be better and better ;).
